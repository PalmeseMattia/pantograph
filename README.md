# Pantograph: Unveiling the Nipple Operand üçº

Welcome to Pantograph, where we take computing to new heights with our revolutionary 25-bit computer ‚Äì complete with the quirkiest operand in town: the Nipple Operand! Yes, you read that right, Nipple Operand. It's like a nibble, but cuter and just a tad more cheeky.

## What's the Deal with Nipples?
We couldn't resist adding a twist to traditional computing jargon, so we proudly present the Nipple Operand ‚Äì 25 bits of pure computational delight. Because why settle for nibbles when you can have nipples?

## How it Works
Our Pantograph framework lets you harness the power of the Nipple Operand through a range of operations. From logical ANDs to summing and subtracting, we've got you covered ‚Äì nipple-style.

## Get Started
To dive into the world of nipple computing (we promise it's SFW), simply import pantograph.single_bit_ops and start playing with those delightful nipples. Don't worry; it's all PG-13.

## Contributing
Think you can handle the nipple? We welcome contributions from brave souls who dare to push the boundaries of computational humor. Just remember, when in doubt, nipple it out!
